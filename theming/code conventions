- Write modular functions
- Use tabs for indentation
- Add comment above each function for documentation and end the comment with your initials and the date
- Function names should use camelCase
- Variable names should use camelCase
- Class names should use TitleCase
- Functions should have this format:

/* This function prints hello world to the screen
 * JM 1/19/18
 */
printHelloWorld(){
    console.write("hello world");
}

- Don't use inline styles
- Every function should have a test case (aim for 100% code coverage)
- A line shouldn't be longer than 100 characters
